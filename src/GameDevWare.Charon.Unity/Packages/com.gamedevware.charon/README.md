# Introduction

Charon is a Unity plugin designed to address common challenges in game  development, such as inefficient management of
static game  data—like skills, items, missions, dialogues, and quests—often handled through
error-prone spreadsheets or manual config files. It provides a  browser-based editing UI that supports the creation of diverse data
structures for any game genre, offering a user-friendly interface for  designers and automated code generation for developers to streamline
workflows. By replacing traditional data management methods with a  structured in-game database, Charon reduces technical overhead, enabling
teams to focus on crafting engaging gameplay experiences.
